		<p>Professor Nyangoni teaches African and Afro-American studies at<a href="http://www.brandeis.edu/" target="_blank"> Brandeis University. </a><br>
		His class was really fun and I enjoyed how he taught the class. He demonstrated a deep knowledge of the politics and economics of the <br>
		Thirld World countries- a subject that I particularly have an interest on. He was born in Zimbabwe and got is PhD in economics and Political Science in <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/home.aspx" target="_blank"> London School of Economics</a>. He worked for several years at the World bank where he was able to experience the side effects of the World Bank's policies to small growing economies of Third World nations. He knows a lot about economics of Third World countries and anyone who cares to learn about the politics and the Economy of Third World nations should definitely take his class!</p>

			<p>My research project was about the effect of knowledge, technological innovation, free market and government policies in the Kenyan Economy.<br>
			I particularly paid a special attention on how the mobile banking (M-Banking) populary known as <em>M-Pesa</em> has contributed to the country's GDP.<br>
			As an economic driving engine in East Africa, Kenya's free market has contributed in increasing the competition between various private businesses which in turn<br>
			benefits both the business owners and the consumers. As a result of competition, quality products are produced, prices adjust to market price, and innovations increase.</p><br>

			 The project has been dubbed <em>where African silicon savannah begins</em> and the park is set to host business process outsourcing (BPO) ventures, a science park,<br>
			 a convention centre, shopping malls, hotels, international schools,and health facility project. The city will be located in Makueni County, 64 km south of Nairobi in 5000 acres of land.</p>
